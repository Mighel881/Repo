			<p>
			Notes's native "find" feature is hidden and annoying to use ... but NotesFind fixes this!
			With NotesFind, simply hold down the share button (on the right of the top toolbar) to search for text!
			</p>

			<p>
				No options to configure!
			</p>

			<p>
				Updated for the latest build of Notes.
