			<p>
			FLEXivator is a developer tool for opening FLEX through Activator events.
			</p>

			<p>
			FLEXivator <b>loads FLEX itself</b> meaning it <b>does not</b> depend on any other FLEX loader (e.g. FLEXing). Only dependencies are libFlex and Activator!
			</p>

            <p>
			Developed by YulkyTulky and DimitarNestorov. Credits to DGh0st's FLEXall off which FLEXivator is branched.
